    <h3>Book 4</h3>
    <img src="../Images/Ian Wright Book.jpeg" alt="Ian Wright Autobiography" title="Ian Wright Autobiography">
    <div class="Book4_Right">
      <p>Ian Wright, Arsenal legend, England striker and TV pundit extraordinaire, is one of modern football's most fascinating and pertinent individuals.
      Everyone's desire to see him to rise from a South London council estate to national treasure. From 'boring, boring Arsenal' to inside the Wenger Revolution; 
      from a week in prison to inspiring young offenders, Ian will reveal everything about his extraordinary life and career.
      Wrighty will also speculate candidly on how retirement affects athletes, why George Graham deserves a statue, social media, music, breaking Arsenal's goal-scoring record, racism, 
      the pure joy of playing with Dennis Bergkamp and of course, what he thinks of Spurs.</p>
